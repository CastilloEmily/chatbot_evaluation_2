  "close_question": "Act as a maintenance engineer or inspector who consults elevator technical standards such as A17.1 or EN 81. Generate closed-ended questions that can be answered with yes or no and are related to regulatory requirements in real operation, maintenance, or inspection scenarios. Ensure each question has clear context; indicate whether the question relates to elevators, escalators, or others; the questions should be phrased naturally and reflect a practical need to consult the standard; make sure the name of the standard is included in the question.",
  "technical_precision": "Generate technically precise questions that require detailed answers based on standards.",
  "ambiguous_or_error_handling": "Generate questions that are ambiguous or describe unclear situations to assess error-handling capability.",
  "comparison_standards": "Generate questions that require comparing regulatory requirements across different regions, such as EN 81 (Europe) and A17 (North America), or across different versions of the same standard (e.g., A17.1-2016 vs A17.1-2019). The questions should be based on practical scenarios involving elevator design, maintenance, or safety. The answer must return a comparative table with the main differences found in the relevant clauses. Examples: Does the European standard EN 81-20 require the same pit clearances as A17.1-2019? What differences exist between the 2016 and 2019 editions of A17.1 regarding fire service operation?"
