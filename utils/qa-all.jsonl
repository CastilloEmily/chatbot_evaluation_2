This document (EN 81-28:2018) has been prepared by Technical Committee CEN/TC 10 Lifts, escalators and moving walks (Secretariat: AFNOR, France). The responsible German body involved in its preparation was DIN-Normenausschuss Maschinenbau (DIN Standards Committee Mechanical Engineering), Working Committee NA 060-33-01 AA \u201cLifts\u201d of Section \u201c \u201d. Representatives of manufacturers and users of lifts, and of the employers liability insurance associations contributed to this standard. This standard contains specifications giving detail to the essential requirements set out in Annex I of the \u201cMachinery Directive\u201d, Directive 2006/42/EC, and which apply to machines that are either first placed on the market or commissioned within the EEA. This standard serves to facilitate proof of compliance with the essential requirements of that directive. Once this standard is cited in the Official Journal of the European Union, it is deemed a \u201charmonized\u201d standard and thus, a manufacturer applying this standard may assume compliance with the requirements of the Machinery Directive (\u201cpresumption of conformity\u201d).

In order to prevent electrical operation of the lift the firefighter keeps the landing door opened, by hand or \u2013 preferably- by means of the ladder which is used to descend to the car roof. At the car roof he will push the stopping device; b) the firefighter on the car roof opens the emergency trap door without key, pulls out the ladder stored on the car and places it into the car; c) the trapped person(s) climbs up the ladder; d) the firefighter and the trapped person escape through the open landing door, if necessary by using the ladder. 7.4 Self rescue procedure a) The trapped firefighter opens the suspended ceiling and unlocks the emergency trap door from inside the car using the unlocking key. Unlocking of the emergency trap door prevents the movement of the lift and allows the emergency trap door to be opened; b) the trapped firefighter climbs to the car roof, using either purpose made stepping points provided in the car or a ladder stored in a cabinet in the car. The car remains stopped until the emergency trap door is closed and relocked with deliberate action; c) the trapped firefighter uses (if necessary) the ladder to reach and release the landing door lock from the well and escapes."}
