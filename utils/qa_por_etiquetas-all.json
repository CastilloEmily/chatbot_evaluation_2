New require- ments have been added to address the means and mem- bers of suspension, compensation, and governor systems for elevators. These new requirements are cov- ered in detail through reference to ASME A17.6, which includes the material properties, design, testing, inspec- tion, and replacement criteria for these means. It includes the requirements for steel wire rope, aramid fiber rope, and noncircular elastomeric-coated steel sus- pension members and provides direction for future con- structions as new technology develops. This twentieth edition of the Code contains well over one hundred revisions made to existing requirements, as well as some new requirements being added, since the publication of the nineteenth edition. New requirements have been added to address new types of elevator equipment being used in the industry, specifically wind turbine elevators and outside emer- gency elevators. In addition, requirements have been added to address a new feature called Elevator Evacuation Operation (EEO) which allows for the use of elevators for occupant evacuation. Besides the above, several major changes include the following: (a) An extensive update to the seismic requirements of the Code that have been revised to include seismic force levels as specified in the latest building codes in the US (IBC) and Canada (NBCC). In order to facilitate incorporation of these requirements, a Guide for Elevator Seismic Design has been separately published."

For this reason, the rescue service needs sufficient capability in respect of: — the hardware capacity necessary to manage the number of connected installations (especially sufficient communication means); — human resources, especially if the rescue service chooses to deactivate the alarm filtering; — trained persons to rescue trapped users; — back-up facilities (see B.6).
