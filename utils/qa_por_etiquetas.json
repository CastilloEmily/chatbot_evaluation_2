This document (EN 81-28:2018) has been prepared by Technical Committee CEN/TC 10 Lifts, escalators and moving walks (Secretariat: AFNOR, France). The responsible German body involved in its preparation was DIN-Normenausschuss Maschinenbau (DIN Standards Committee Mechanical Engineering), Working Committee NA 060-33-01 AA “Lifts” of Section “ ”. Representatives of manufacturers and users of lifts, and of the employers liability insurance associations contributed to this standard. This standard contains specifications giving detail to the essential requirements set out in Annex I of the “Machinery Directive”, Directive 2006/42/EC, and which apply to machines that are either first placed on the market or commissioned within the EEA. This standard serves to facilitate proof of compliance with the essential requirements of that directive. Once this standard is cited in the Official Journal of the European Union, it is deemed a “harmonized” standard and thus, a manufacturer applying this standard may assume compliance with the requirements of the Machinery Directive (“presumption of conformity”). Amendments This standard differs from DIN EN 81-28:2003-11 as follows: a) the standard has been updated by deleting the references to EN 81-1 and EN 81-2 and replacing them with reference to EN 81-20; b) the status of any battery used for alarm operation and its correct charging is now indicated; c) sound levels for the alarm system and their range of adjustment have been included; d) indication, at the lift car, of failure of alarm system to be able to communicate with the rescue service"

Part 2 Aramid Fiber Ropes for Elevators SECTION 2.1 SCOPE Part 2 covers the general requirements for aramid fiber ropes for suspension and compensation applications on elevators within the Scope of ASME A17.1/CSA B44. NOTE: This Part is written in the combined format, presenting requirements for rope products in both Imperial units, utilized historically in the U.S. Customary and SI units as recognized by CSA B44 and ASME A17.1 standards. The values stated in SI (metric) units or Imperial units are to be regarded separately. The values are not exact equivalents; therefore, each system must be used independently of the other. SECTION 2.2 REFERENCES Part 2 incorporates by dated or undated reference, provisions from other publications. These normative references are cited at their appropriate place in the text, and the publications are listed. For dated references, subsequent amendments to or revisions of any of these publications apply to this Standard only when incorpo- rated by amendment or revision. For undated references, the latest edition would apply. ANSI/ASQC Q9001, Quality management systems — Requirements Publisher: American Society for Quality (ASQ), P.O.
